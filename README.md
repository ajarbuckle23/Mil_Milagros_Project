# Mil Milagros Project

## Mil Milagros is a non-profit that aims to reduce child malnutrition in rural communities in Guatemala. In this project, I consolidated 10 years worth of health check-up data from various sources into one spreadsheet ready for upload to an online database, then analyzed the data to identify potential areas to improve their program.
